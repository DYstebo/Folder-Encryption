# Folder-Encryption
This batch file and PowerShell script combo allows you to encrypt and decrypt a password protected folder/zipped file at will.
<br><br>
To prepare for use, open PowerShell as Administrator and enter "Install-Module -Name 7Zip4Powershell".<br><br>
Download either the Dynamic or Static PowerShell script and batch file. <br>
Static will require you to edit the PS1 file to include your main folder path, your folder name, and your zipped file name (or what you want the name to be).<br>
Dynamic will ask you for the absolute paths every time the batch or PS1 file is ran.
